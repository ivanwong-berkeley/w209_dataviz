    "_In this assignment you will be using your final project dataset and exploring it with your tool of choice from the course (d3/vegalite/altair/Tableau). Begin by inspecting the available data without visualizing the data, and write down three hypotheses. Next, investigate each of your hypotheses by visualizing relevant variables (including derived variables, if that helps) in multiple ways. Look for correlations, clusters, outliers, or any other patterns. See if you can find evidence for or against each hypothesis. As you explore, retain multiple sheets in your workbook that show the development of your analysis. Try to find something unexpected in the data. For only one of the hypotheses, describe your exploration process, noting changes and refinements you made to the visualizations as you went along, as well as what worked or didn’t work during your exploration process. We expect to see at least three steps in this refinement process. For the remaining two hypotheses, list each hypothesis and conclusion, provide the beginning and final visualization._\n"
